[Firebase Auth with Identity
Platform](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?hl=en&authuser=1&_gl=1*1oolcop*_ga*Mjk1NzA5MjQ0LjE2ODMwODA2MTY.*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTY4NzgwNDE4OC4yMi4xLjE2ODc4MDQzMzguMC4wLjA.#identity-platform).

## Dev Commands

-   Start the app locally for development at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with `yarn start`.

-   Build the app locally in [/build](/build) with `yarn build`.

-   Serve the app locally from [/build](/build) to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with `yarn serve`.

-   Build then deploy the app to Firebase with `yarn deploy`.

Usually `yarn start` is all that is needed during development. The project is set up to build, deploy, and serve
itself on every push to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/blaketyro/react-firebase9-logins).
